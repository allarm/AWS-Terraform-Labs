* First AWS Lab

For my AWS labs I am using a =LinuxAcademy= =AWS= sandbox.

* Authentication

A ~wrong~ approach to your secrets is having them hard-coded in your =Terraform= code. You should not do that, it is not safe. But yeah, you can.

#+begin_src terraform
provider "aws" {
  region     = "us-west-2"
  access_key = "my-access-key"
  secret_key = "my-secret-key"
}
#+end_src

The =right= way to do it is to keep the secrets in enviromental variables. BTW, I don't see any harm in keeping the default region setting hard-coded.

#+begin_src bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="anaccesskey"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="asecretkey"
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="us-west-1"
#+end_src
